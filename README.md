# insta-clone
I implemented both Server-side and Client-side versions of an instagram clone as part of EECS485. I have decided to keep the code private as per course polict.

Language Used: (Server) Python, Flask, (Client) Python, JS, React
Packages: Jinja2, Click(to parse Commandline arguments), Shell Scripting to run tests

Here is a video that showcases some features like infinite scroll, liking, following, commenting, etc. There is also other features (logging in, creating new users, uploading posts) that was not shown in the video.
