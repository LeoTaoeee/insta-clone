# insta-clone
I implemented both Server-side and Client-side versions of an instagram clone as part of EECS485. I have decided to keep the code private as per course polict.

Language Used: (Server) Python, Flask, (Client) Python, JS, React
Packages: Jinja2, Click(to parse Commandline arguments), Shell Scripting to run tests

Here is some sample screenshot of the website.<img width="1704" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-28 at 1 48 44 AM" src="https://github.com/LeoTaoeee/insta-clone/assets/91030023/01846db4-170d-4279-99ee-d1bd7f3ed36e">
