This is a Static Website Generator completed as part of EECS485.

Language Used: HTML,CSS,Python
Packages: Jinja2, Click(to parse Commandline arguments)

I wrote multiple html template files. Then I wrote some python code that used Jinja2 to load templates in pre-determined format and then render them. I then wrote some code in html and jinja that will take the rendered data and output correct html code. Then I wrote a script that will automatically clean up left over files from the previous run and generate a website based on the rendered html files. 

Here is some sample screenshot of the website.<img width="1704" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-28 at 1 48 44 AM" src="https://github.com/LeoTaoeee/insta-clone/assets/91030023/01846db4-170d-4279-99ee-d1bd7f3ed36e">
